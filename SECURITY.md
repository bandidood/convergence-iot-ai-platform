| **üü† High** | Significant security impact | Privilege escalation, SQL injection |
| **üü° Medium** | Moderate security impact | Cross-site scripting, information disclosure |
| **üü¢ Low** | Limited security impact | Rate limiting bypass, minor information leak |

## üéñÔ∏è **Security Recognition Program**

### **Vulnerability Bounty**

We operate a responsible disclosure program with recognition for security researchers:

| Severity | Recognition |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | ‚Ç¨1,000 + Hall of Fame |
| **High** | ‚Ç¨500 + Hall of Fame |
| **Medium** | ‚Ç¨200 + Hall of Fame |
| **Low** | ‚Ç¨50 + Hall of Fame |

### **Hall of Fame**

Recognition for researchers who have contributed to our security:

- *[Your Name Here]* - First security researcher to contribute

## üîß **Security Development Lifecycle**

### **Secure Coding Practices**

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning with SonarQube and Bandit
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing with OWASP ZAP
- **Dependency Scanning**: Continuous monitoring with Snyk and Trivy
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog and detect-secrets integration
- **Code Reviews**: Mandatory security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE-based threat analysis

### **CI/CD Security Gates**

Our deployment pipeline includes mandatory security checkpoints:

1. **Source Code Analysis**: SAST scanning before build
2. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: SCA before packaging
3. **Container Image Scanning**: Security analysis before push
